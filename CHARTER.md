# Technical Charter (the "Charter") for Carbyne Stack

> [!NOTE] This charter has been adopted by the Carbyne Stack project on TBD.

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical
contribution to, and oversight of, the Carbyne Stack open source project (the
"Project‚Äù), which has been established as a project of Linux Foundation Europe,
a Belgian private stichting headquartered at Kunstlaan 56, Brussels ("LF
Europe"). All contributors (including maintainers, and other technical
positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, "Collaborators")
must comply with the terms of this Charter.

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

1. The mission of the Project is to enable secure collaborative computing on
   encrypted data by leveraging Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC).

1. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project
   License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation,
   testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the
   development, deployment, operation or adoption of the Project.

## 2. Technical Steering Committee

1. The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") will be responsible for all
   technical oversight of the Project.

1. Composition

   1. <ins>Startup Period</ins>. From the inception of the Project until the TSC
      transitions to the "Steady State Period" as described in Section 2.2.ii.,
      the voting members of the TSC consist of one appointed representative from
      each organization named in the "GOVERNANCE" file within the `governance`
      repository of the Project.

   1. <ins>Steady State Period</ins>. Within 2 years following the inception of
      the Project, or at such other date as determined by the TSC, the TSC will
      adopt an alternative structure for determining voting members of the TSC
      (such as having elections from among contributors, having maintainers or a
      subset of maintainers make up the voting members, etc.). Any such
      structure approach will be documented in the GOVERNANCE file.

1. At any time the TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the
   voting members of the TSC via a vote by the voting members as provided in
   Section 3. Any such alternative approach will be documented in the GOVERNANCE
   file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be
   open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference,
   or in person.

1. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Maintainers. The TSC may
   adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the GOVERNANCE
   file. Unless otherwise documented:

   1. The Project implements a contribution-request workflow. Any interested
      person may contribute to the Project by submitting a contribution request.
      This includes anyone in the technical community that contributes code,
      documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;

   1. Maintainers are Contributors who have earned the ability to approve and
      merge contribution requests, modify ("commit") source code, documentation
      or other technical artifacts in a project's repository. Maintainers are
      set on a per-repository basis. Maintainers are encouraged to also follow
      the regular contribution request workflow in their ongoing technical work;
      and

   1. A Contributor may become a Maintainer by a recommendation of the existing
      Maintainers of the repository to the TSC, following approval by the TSC. A
      Maintainer may be removed by a recommendation of the other existing
      Maintainers of the repository, following approval by the TSC. In case the
      Maintainers of the repository are not able to make decisions on
      maintainership, the TSC may decide to appoint new maintainers to the
      repository.

1. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor or Maintainer is
   open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.

1. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval,
   and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of
   Contributors to Maintainer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust,
   refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Maintainers, and
   create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

1. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and
   will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.

1. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight
   relating to the Project, which may include:

   1. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

   1. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to,
      incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project's scope);

   1. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;

   1. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project
      technical issues and requirements;

   1. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open
      standards communities;

   1. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security
      issue reporting policies;

   1. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be
      published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with LF Europe to
      resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of
      this Charter;

   1. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical
      matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and

   1. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the
      Project.

## 3. TSC Voting

1. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC
   decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of
   the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. Each member of the
   TSC may submit one named alternate to the TSC who may attend meetings and
   vote on their behalf as a voting member of the TSC when the member is not
   available to attend.

1. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members
   of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met
   but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

1. Except as provided in Section 7.3. and 8.1, decisions by vote at a meeting
   require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met.
   Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote
   of all voting members of the TSC.

1. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the
   TSC may refer the matter to LF Europe for assistance in reaching a
   resolution.

## 4. Compliance with Policies

1. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Europe as may be adopted and
   amended by LF Europe, including, without limitation the policies listed at
   <https://linuxfoundation.eu/policies/>.

1. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct ("CoC") for the Project, which is subject
   to approval by LF Europe. In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not
   been approved, the LF Europe Code of Conduct listed at
   <https://linuxfoundation.eu/policies/> will apply for all Collaborators in
   the Project.

1. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Europe
   will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at
   least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in
   the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF
   Europe, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project's web
   site.

1. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or
   organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and
   any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of
   competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek
   to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason
   other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory
   basis to all Collaborators in the Project community.

1. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical
   manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals,
   timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to
   all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported
   immediately to LF Europe.

## 5. Community Assets

1. LF Europe will hold title to all trade or service marks used by the Project
   ("Project Trademarks"), whether based on common law or registered rights.
   Project Trademarks will be transferred and assigned to LF Europe to hold on
   behalf of the Project. Any use of any Project Trademarks by Collaborators in
   the Project will be in accordance with the license from LF Europe and inure
   to the benefit of LF Europe.

1. The Project will, as permitted and in accordance with such license from LF
   Europe, develop and own all Project GitHub and social media accounts, and
   domain name registrations created by the Project community.

1. Under no circumstances will LF Europe be expected or required to undertake
   any action on behalf of the Project that is inconsistent with the tax-exempt
   status or purpose, as applicable, of LF Europe.

## 6. General Rules and Operations

1. The Project will:

   1. engage in the work of the Project in a professional manner consistent with
      maintaining a cohesive community, while also maintaining the goodwill and
      esteem of LF Europe and other partner organizations in the open source
      community; and
